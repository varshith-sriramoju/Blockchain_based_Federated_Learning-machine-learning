This project is a college mini-project aimed at enhancing the security and privacy of Federated Learning (FL) systems. By integrating Blockchain technology and Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC),
the system ensures secure data aggregation and robust model verification, protecting against poisoning attacks while preserving data privacy.

üîç Key Features
Federated Learning with Privacy Preservation:
Collaborative training of machine learning models without sharing raw data.

Blockchain Integration:
Immutable and decentralized ledger to securely store and verify model updates.

Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC):
Cryptographic techniques for secure aggregation and validation of model updates without exposing individual data.

Anomaly Detection:
Identification and mitigation of poisoning attacks to maintain model integrity.

User-Friendly Modules:
Healthcare Data Manager: Handles data training, testing, and analysis tasks.
Healthcare Data Users: Allows users to register, monitor poisoning attacks, and view results.
